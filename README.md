## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Trains a fully connected MLP on MNIST  
- 📊 Plots training loss, accuracy curves, and confusion matrix  
- 🔍 Evaluates final model performance on a held‑out test set  
- 🖼️ Predicts custom images (resize, threshold, normalize)  
- 📓 Available as both a standalone Python script (`main.py`) and Jupyter Notebook
